# Main page of the project Toolbox-WASI

Here is the main page for the project Toolbox WAve SImulation, where we gather the useful numerical tools for a wave propagation simulation.
Currently 2 libraries below are actively developed:  

- [SPECFEM2D_on_windows_with_boat](https://toolbox-wasi.github.io/SPECFEM2D_on_docker_with_boat/)  
A utility library which provides a possibility to use SPECFEM2D on Windows10 or other any kind of operating systems (Linux, OSX).
Also the user interface for generation of simulation configuration and post processings are available with this library, which is implemented on the base of JupyterLab.

- [SPECFEM3D_on_windows_with_boat](https://toolbox-wasi.github.io/SPECFEM3D_on_docker_with_boat/)  
This is the SPECFEM3D version of the library above.
